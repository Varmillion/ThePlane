An Airplane with CSS
It's an airplane that i have created using CSS.
Then to complete the scene or fill the scene, i used an img file of the clouds that are moving in the background.

Id you are getting bored and want to spend some time alone and can not afford an airplane ticket, just put on your earphones/headphones, and open the HTML file and keep on watching.
Happy Journey. :D
